# hello-world
Git-ing to know how this works, amirite?

## Why am I doing this?
You may be thinking, "Now why the hecking is Alex doing this right now?", and you'd be right to ask that.
But the reality is that I'm writing this in a private repository that only I will ever see, so there's that too.

I guess I'm just kinda putzing around trying to figure out this whole Git thing to make cool stuff and whatnot.

## At this point, I'm going to mess around with markdown...

### This is an unordered list
- Who
- What
- Where
- When
- Why

### This is an ordered list
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
4. Fourth
5. Fifth

## Sorry the image in my last merge was crude.
How about something a little more educational? Let's explore the magic of markdown?

So the first heading used in this README seems to be an H1; check out "hello-world" at the top of this document.

The susbsequent heading "Why am I doing this?" is an H2 and the headings for the lists are H3s.

# This is an H1
## This is an H2
### This is an H3
#### This is an H4
##### This is an H5
###### And this, well I mean awh...just look at this cute little H6. It's the smollest boi we have available to us.

## Styling text

What's your style boo? You like to be **BIG AND BOLD**? Or do you *emphasize* like a *smooth operator*?

What if you want to ~~spend an afternoon watching the Bachelorette with a tub of ice cream~~ strikethrough a mistake? Well you can use these little ~ tilde bois!
